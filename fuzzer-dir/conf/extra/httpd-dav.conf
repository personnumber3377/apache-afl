# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)

# Required modules: mod_alias, mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_core, mod_authn_file,

#                   mod_setenvif

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a 
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle
